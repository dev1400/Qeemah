wsap1=<br/><font>Saudi Arabia has long been recognized as a powerhouse of the Middle East. Now it&apos;s poised to become one of the world&apos;s top 10 most competitive nations and with that one of the most lucrative markets for strategic investment.</font> 
wsap2=<p>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is undergoing an exciting transformation. One of the most enterprising nations in the Middle East, Saudi&apos;s vast natural energy combined with the long-term vision and strategic planning of its rulers has helped to create today&apos;s stable, robust economy. Now, Saudi is looking to the future with an ambitious program of accelerated growth and development that will position it firmly as a new global force.</p>
wsap3=<font color="#01456A"><b>To capitalize on these geographic advantages, Saudi has set itself three strategic targets:</b></font><ul><li>To become the global capital of energy. Up and downstream petrochemicals, minerals, power and water are all vital to the Saudi and global economy.</li><li>To act as a transport and logistical hub between east and west. KSA&apos;s roads, railways and air links create a potential consumer base of more than 250 million, all within 3 hours&apos; reach.</li><li>To transform its knowledge-based industries, healthcare, life science, education and IT. These industries are all crucial drivers of long-term, sustainable change.</li></ul>
wsap4h=<font color="#01456A"><b>Building a nation of sustainable prosperity</b></font>
wsap4p1=<p>KSA is a nation that is looking to and preparing for, a different kind of future, a future that&apos;s more inclusive, expansive, sustainable and integrated on both economic and social levels; a future that revolves around investment. New communications infrastructures, new transport routes, state of the art industrial complexes, dynamic training opportunities and a commitment to greater business efficiencies \u2013 all of these things and many more will be delivered through Saudi&apos;s focused investment, helping to build a nation of sustainable prosperity.</p> 
wsap4p2=<p>The Kingdom is investing massively to enhance its value proposition to foreign businesses, both with infrastructure and with reform. His Majesty King Abdullah bin AbdulAziz Al Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, has directed the Saudi government to become one of the world&apos;s Top 10 most competitive economies . In pursuit of this goal, the organs of government have initiated a multi-faceted reform strategy that has made the Kingdom one of the easiest places in the world to do business.</p>
